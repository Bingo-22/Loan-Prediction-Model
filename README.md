# Loan-Prediction-Model

Every day many people apply for loans, for a variety of purposes. But not all the applicants are reliable, and not everyone can be approved. Every year, there are cases where people do not repay the bulk of the loan amount to the bank which results in huge financial loss. The risk associated with making a decision on a loan approval is immense. Hence, the idea of this project is to gather loan data and use machine learning techniques to analyze the data and predict if a customer would be able to repay the loan or not.

 We can forecast whether a given application is safe or not using this approach, and the entire feature validation procedure is automated using machine learning techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Logistic Regression.
